# Introduction
This is a simple chrome extension that allows you to copy the id of a steam workshop file easily. If you have nothing selected on the workshop page, simply press CTRL + C and it will copy the ID to your clipboard. You can still copy "normally" on workshop pages. For that simply select something on the site.

# Installing
To install this extension, go to your extension page and enable the developer mode. Then click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the extension files.
